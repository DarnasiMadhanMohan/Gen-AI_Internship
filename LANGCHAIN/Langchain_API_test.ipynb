Newton's Laws of Motion: These laws, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, describe how objects move in response to forces. The first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\\n\\n2. Law of Conservation of Energy: This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. This means that the total energy in a closed system remains constant.\\n\\n3. Law of Conservation of Mass: This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
